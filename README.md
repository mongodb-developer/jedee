# JEDEE: Jupyter EDEE

This repo is an implementation of the Enterprise Development Environment Emulator that we use at MongoDB to provide a quick and simple way to start coding against a MongoDB database.

Instead of creating a new MongoDB Atlas Cluster (which BTW is a good idea as those are [Free Forever](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)), then importing some data, write code, etc. here you start a new Github Codespace, wait a few minutes and you can start writing code in a Jupyter Notebook.
