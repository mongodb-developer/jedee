Even As The Besieged Attorney Looks After His Ailing Wife, Feaver Must Also Make Tapes That Will Hurl His Friends, His Enemies, His City, And A Particular Fbi Undercover Agent Into A Crisis Of Conscience And Law. Now Robbie Feaver Is Making The Play Of His Life.<h3>salon - Jonathan Groner</h3>lawyer-turned-writer Scott Turow Caught The Elusive Bubble Of Fame In 1987 With The Publication Of <i>presumed Innocent</i>, An Intense, Taut Mystery Narrated By A First-person, Morally Ambiguous Attorney. Set In Fictional Kindle County, Clearly A Stand-in For Cook County (where Turow Still Practices Law), That Novel Practically Invented The Late 20th Century Genre Of The Legal Thriller. (john Grisham Gets Some Credit As Well, But Grisham -- An Earnest, Plodding Moralist With An Acute Feel For The American Hatred Of Large Law Firms And Corporations -- Has Inspired Fewer Imitators.) After Two Middling Follow-ups, <i>the Burden Of Proof</i> (1990) And <i>pleading Guilty</i> (1993), Turow Again Fulfilled His Potential With <i>the Laws Of Our Fathers</i> (1996), A Thriller That Evoked The Streets And Straits Of The Urban Ghetto With A Darkness That Few Novelists From Outside The Ghetto Would Even Attempt. now, With <i>personal Injuries</i>, Again Set In His Favorite County Of The Imagination, Turow Turns To A New Topic: The Casual Corruption That Can Infect A Big City's Court System. The Novel Marks A Watershed For Turow: All The Legal Twists And Turns Are Still There, But This Time The Author Focuses His Fullest Attention On Character, Scene And Subplot. His Kindle County Is An Urban MÃ©lange Of Venal Court Clerks, Self-righteous Prosecutors, Corrupt Cops And Judges Who Sit On The Bench Only Because They Once Knew The Right Politician. It's An Almost Dickensian Fictional World -- And Indeed, On His Web Site Turow Calls Dickens A Profound Influence Who Created Robust Characters Without Giving Up His Principal Mission As A Storyteller. (his Other Major Influence, He Says, Is Fellow Urban Chronicler And Chicagoan Saul Bellow.) into This Morally Compromised Environment Turow Drops Robbie Feaver, A Personal-injury Lawyer Who Has Been Bribing Judges For Years. The Name Is Pronounced As In Do Me A Favor, Feaver Quickly Tells Us, And That Phrase Just About Sums Up His Legal Career. Cornered At Last By Prosecutors And The Fbi, Who Persuade Him That His Only Way Of Avoiding Prison Is To Wear A Wire, Feaver Makes His Tortuous Way Through A Labyrinth Of Corruption As He And The Feds Try To Trap The Elusive Leader Of The Bribery Ring. An Inveterate Womanizer, A Nonstop Wisecracker And A Man With Plenty In His Past To Hide, Feaver Still Retains His Unshakable Sense Of Loyalty And His Own Style Of Fidelity To His Wife, Lorraine, Who Is Slowly Dying Of Lou Gehrig's Disease. the Novel Intertwines Three Tales: Of Robbie's Adventures As An Undercover Agent In An Extremely Elaborate Sting; Of Fbi Agent Evon Miller's Transformation After She Is Assigned To Keep An Eye On Him; And Of Lorraine's Slow, Sad Deterioration. As The Three Strands Come Together Toward The End, Each Character Deepens And Grows In Humanity. the Book Doesn't Pack Much Mystery, Though. Once The Main Action Is Under Way And Feaver, Wired For Sight And Sound, Has Set Out Among The Judges And The Courtroom Lackeys, There Are Few Surprises. But <i>personal Injuries</i> Succeeds As A Long Look At A World Where Greed, Sloth And Lust Hold Sway Despite The Efforts Of Some Good Men And Women.\",\"cover\":\"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/02/9780446608602.jpg\",\"totalInventory\":2,\"available\":2,\"longTitle\":\"Personal Injuries\",\"bookOfTheMonth\":null,\"tags\":\"comic,photography\",\"publisherId\":839,\"bindingId\":12,\"languageId\":1,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":3,\"name\":\"Scott Turow\"}],\"binding\":{\"id\":12,\"name\":\"Mass Market Paperback\"},\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"dimensions\",\"value\":\"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.125 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches\"},{\"key\":\"isbn13\",\"value\":\"9780446608602\"},{\"key\":\"msrp\",\"value\":\"7.99\"},{\"key\":\"isbn\",\"value\":\"446608602\"},{\"key\":\"isbn10\",\"value\":\"446608602\"}],\"publisher\":{\"id\":839,\"name\":\"Grand Central Publishing\"}}]}\n",

And his only ally is&#160;&#160;a woman named Reggie Love, who has been a lawyer&#160;&#160;for all of four years. Prosecutors are&#160;&#160;willing to break all the rules to make Mark talk.

Eleven-year-old Mark Sway, taking his kid brother for a smoke behind their Memphis trailer park, witnesses the suicide of a lawyer ``driven crazy'' by a lethal secret. Before he dies, the man confides to Mark where the body of a recently murdered U.S. senator lies buried, and the game's afoot. Trailed by the police, the FBI and assorted Mafia types (the deceased politico was the victim of ``a successful New Orleans street thug''), Mark retains--for one dollar--the services of Reggie Love, a 50ish female lawyer. This uncommon attorney-client relationship adds an affecting, unusually humanistic layer to the novel's tension-filled events. Mark, raised by a divorced mother and wise beyond his years, thinks chiefly in terms of movies and TV; Reggie, a street-smart survivor of an acrimonious divorce, is often unsure whether to hug or slug her precocious client. True to form, Grisham employs just enough foreshadowing to keep the suspense rolling (``Neither of them could know that . . . ''), and propels his action at the requisite breakneck pace. Occasional plot improbabilities and stylistic quibbles--a few fuzzy characterizations; overstatement of already obvious points; Mark's sporadic adult phraseology--will not deter readers from enjoying a rousing read. 950,000 first printing; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club main selections; Reader's Digest Condensed Book selection.

For between the two men is a chasm of shame, family lies, and secrets -- including the one secret that could save Sam Cayhall's life...or cost Adam his.<h3>Walter Goodman</h3>So, let's begin with a word of reassurance. If you find your fingers racing through these 486 pages, it may signify merely that few of them demand close study. And as for putting the book down, I managed to do it without pain a score of times....Mr. Grisham has no pretensions to being a stylist. As with most other popular novels, the language does not bear inspection. Its main function is to deliver information, and you don't have to read absolutely every word, because all significant facts are repeated, usually more than once. Everything is made explicit; one's imagination is never imposed on. -- New York Times\",\"cover\":\"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/21/9780385424721.jpg\",\"totalInventory\":2,\"available\":2,\"longTitle\":\"The Chamber: A Novel\",\"bookOfTheMonth\":null,\"tags\":\"courtroom drama,middle grade,humor\",\"publisherId\":1209,\"bindingId\":19,\"languageId\":1,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":8,\"name\":\"John Grisham\"}],\"binding\":{\"id\":19,\"name\":\"Hardcover\"},\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"edition\",\"value\":\"1st\"},{\"key\":\"dimensions\",\"value\":\"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.41 Inches, Weight: 1.77 Pounds, Width: 1.46 Inches\"},{\"key\":\"isbn13\",\"value\":\"9780385424721\"},{\"key\":\"msrp\",\"value\":\"35\"},{\"key\":\"isbn\",\"value\":\"385424728\"},{\"key\":\"isbn10\",\"value\":\"385424728\"}],\"publisher\":{\"id\":1209,\"name\":\"Doubleday\"}},{\"_id\":\"192781510\",\"title\":\"Time to Kill\",\"pages\":null,\"year\":1993,\"synopsis\":\"John Grisham.\",\"cover\":\"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/80/9780385470780.jpg\",\"totalInventory\":1,\"available\":1,\"longTitle\":\"Time to Kill\",\"bookOfTheMonth\":null,\"tags\":\"nature writing,ish,author event\",\"publisherId\":1209,\"bindingId\":19,\"languageId\":1,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":8,\"name\":\"John Grisham\"}],\"binding\":{\"id\":19,\"name\":\"Hardcover\"},\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"edition\",\"value\":\"Large Print\"},{\"key\":\"dimensions\",\"value\":\"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches\"},{\"key\":\"isbn13\",\"value\":\"9780385470780\"},{\"key\":\"msrp\",\"value\":\"27\"},{\"key\":\"isbn\",\"value\":\"385470789\"},{\"key\":\"isbn10\",\"value\":\"385470789\"}],\"genre\":[{\"genreId\":2240,\"name\":\"Trials (Murder)\"},{\"genreId\":7794,\"name\":\"Mississippi\"},{\"genreId\":559,\"name\":\"Fiction\"},{\"genreId\":4013,\"name\":\"Murder\"}],\"publisher\":{\"id\":1209,\"name\":\"Doubleday\"}},{\"_id\":\"393047350\",\"title\":\"A Painted House\",\"pages\":400,\"year\":2001,\"synopsis\":\"The Hill People And The Mexicans Arrived On The Same Day.

The company is based in Chicago but originated as a weekly print publication on August 29, 1988, in Madison, Wisconsin. The Onion began publishing online in early 1996. In 2007, they began publishing satirical news audio and video online as the Onion News Network. In 2013, The Onion ceased publishing its print edition and launched Onion Labs, an advertising agency.The Onion's articles cover current events, both real and fictional, parodying the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, and man-on-the-street interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the Associated Press. The publication's humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal, or alarming, such as \\\"Rotation Of Earth Plunges Entire North American Continent Into Darkness\\\". In 1999, comedian Bob Odenkirk praised the publication as \\\"the best comedy writing in the country\\\".The Onion also runs The A.V.

Mary-Kate and Ashley made their acting debut as infants playing Michelle Tanner on the television sitcom Full House (1987–1995). As they grew older, they began starring in other television shows, films, and media through their own production company, Dualstar. The twins became preteen icons, and some of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age.\\\\nThe Olsens stepped away from acting in the mid-2000s and entered the fashion design industry. They founded their own luxury fashion label in 2006, The Row, based in New York City. They have won several awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).\",\"awards\":null,\"aliases\":[\"Olsen, Mary-Kate & Ashley\",\"Olsen, Mary-kate & Ashley\",\"Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen\",\"Mary-kate & Ashley Olsen\"],\"books\":[\"60528125\",\"60142278\",\"60540958\"],\"booksWritten\":[{\"_id\":\"60528125\",\"title\":\"Two for the Road (Mary-Kate & Ashley: Two of a Kind Diaries, No. 18)\",\"pages\":128,\"year\":2001,\"synopsis\":\"While In Florida On Their School Trip, Mary-kate Searches For Her Lost Diary And Ashley Worries About Competition From Dana Woletsky.\",\"cover\":\"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/80/9780061066580.jpg\",\"totalInventory\":1,\"available\":1,\"longTitle\":\"Two for the Road (Mary-Kate & Ashley: Two of a Kind Diaries, No. 18)\",\"bookOfTheMonth\":null,\"tags\":\"travel writing,shelfie,legal thriller\",\"publisherId\":142,\"bindingId\":6,\"languageId\":1,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":10,\"name\":\"Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen\"}],\"binding\":{\"id\":6,\"name\":\"Paperback\"},\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"dimensions\",\"value\":\"Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches\"},{\"key\":\"isbn13\",\"value\":\"9780061066580\"},{\"key\":\"msrp\",\"value\":\"4.99\"},{\"key\":\"isbn\",\"value\":\"61066583\"},{\"key\":\"isbn10\",\"value\":\"61066583\"}],\"publisher\":{\"id\":142,\"name\":\"HarperEntertainment\"}},{\"_id\":\"60142278\",\"title\":\"So Little Time #9: Dating Game\",\"pages\":128,\"year\":2003,\"synopsis\":\"The Twins Have A Lot To Do To Find Dates For Mom, Dad, Manuelo, And Themselves.\",\"cover\":\"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/36/9780060093136.jpg\",\"totalInventory\":2,\"available\":2,\"longTitle\":\"So Little Time #9: Dating Game\",\"bookOfTheMonth\":null,\"tags\":\"energy,speculative fiction\",\"publisherId\":142,\"bindingId\":12,\"languageId\":1,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":10,\"name\":\"Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen\"}],\"binding\":{\"id\":12,\"name\":\"Mass Market Paperback\"},\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"edition\",\"value\":\"Dgs\"},{\"key\":\"dimensions\",\"value\":\"Height: 7.625 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches\"},{\"key\":\"isbn13\",\"value\":\"9780060093136\"},{\"key\":\"msrp\",\"value\":\"4.99\"},{\"key\":\"isbn\",\"value\":\"60093137\"},{\"key\":\"isbn10\",\"value\":\"60093137\"}],\"publisher\":{\"id\":142,\"name\":\"HarperEntertainment\"},\"reviews\":[{\"text\":\"This book was absolutely amazing!
