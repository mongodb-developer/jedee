Erik von Darkmoor, bastard son of the local baron, flees to the city of Krondor after accidentally killing his legitimate and sadistic half-brother. Condemned to death, Eric and his childhood friend, Rupert (Roo) Avery, are provisionally spared to serve in a desperate mission against the reptilian Pantathians, who plan to conquer Midkemia and bring back their goddess, Alma-Lodaka, one of the ancient Dragon Lords. The boys undergo brutal training and join others of their kind under the half-elf Calis, known as the Eagle of Krondor, in a bid to pass as mercenaries in the continent of Novindus, current battle center for the Pantathians and their reluctant allies, the also-reptilian Saaur. A sensitive coming-of-age tale in which brutality and camaraderie are equally present, Feist's newest saga has a freshness of vision that suggests it will avoid the staleness that often eats away at multivolume epics.

Shortly after her arrival, the prim 32-year-old receives a life-threatening letter. She refuses, however, to let the letter put a damper on her opportunity to experience real freedom--at least until, at her father's insistence, NOPD officer Beau Dupree is assigned as her bodyguard for the duration of her stay. Dupree, who spent the past decade raising three sisters after his parents' untimely death, is equally unhappy about the situation and has better things to do than baby-sit a grown woman, especially a snobby Yankee. Andersen (Baby I'm Yours) captures the undeniable attraction of opposites in Dupree and Lowell's steamy relationship.

Lisa Carlson has collected cartoons, jokes, funny quotations, humorous last words, and a wide range of other old and new material. As the advice columnist Dear Abby remarked, \"This book proves that dying can be a laughing matter.\" At the end of each section, Carlson has a page or two of information and advice for those who may someday have the job of arranging a funeral for a friend or relative, or who may be contemplating the arrangements they prefer when they die.Half the profits from sale of the book will be contributed to the work of the national nonprofit consumer organization, Funeral Consumers Alliance. Several well-known cartoonists and illustrators made their work available in support of this cause: these include P.S. Mueller, Rina Picccolo, and the estate of Edward Gorey.With this short book, you can have a good laugh, learn something in process, and support good cause at the same time.', 'cover': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17144333482523.jpg', 'attributes': [{'key': 'edition', 'value': 'New Edition'}, {'key': 'dimensions', 'value': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.32628414776 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches'}, {'key': 'isbn13', 'value': '9780942679250'}, {'key': 'msrp', 'value': 7.64}, {'key': 'isbn', 'value': '0942679253'}, {'key': 'isbn10', 'value': '0942679253'}], 'available': 2, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'language': 'en', 'longTitle': 'I Died Laughing: Funeral Education with a Light Touch', 'publisher': 'Upper Access, Inc.'}.\n",
