Allison performed the ritualized tasks of a hostess in one of Tokyo\\'s many \"hostess clubs\"&#58; pouring drinks, lighting cigarettes, and making flattering or titillating conversation with the businessmen who came there on company expense accounts. Her book critically examines how such establishments create bonds among white-collar men and forge a masculine identity that suits the needs of their corporations.Allison describes in detail a typical company outing to such a club&#8212;what the men do, how they interact with the hostesses, the role the hostess is expected to play, and the extent to which all of this involves \"play\" rather than \"work.\" Unlike previous books on Japanese nightlife, Allison\\'s ethnography of one specific hostess club (here referred to as Bijo) views the general phenomenon from the eyes of a woman, hostess, and feminist anthropologist. Observing that clubs like Bijo further a kind of masculinity dependent on the gestures and labors of women, Allison seeks to uncover connections between such behavior and other social, economic, sexual, and gendered relations. She argues that Japanese corporate nightlife enables and institutionalizes a particular form of ritualized male dominance&#58; in paying for this entertainment, Japanese corporations not only give their male workers a self-image as phallic man, but also develop relationships to work that are unconditional and unbreakable. This is a book that will appeal to anyone interested in gender roles or in contemporary Japanese society.', 'cover': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/76/9780226014876.jpg', 'totalInventory': 1, 'available': 1, 'longTitle': 'Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club', 'bookOfTheMonth': None, 'tags': 'self-published,photography,courtroom drama', 'publisherId': 1379, 'bindingId': 15, 'languageId': 1, 'authors': [{'authorId': 5658, 'name': 'Anne Allison'}], 'binding': {'id': 15, 'name': 'Kindle Edition'}, 'attributes': [{'key': 'edition', 'value': '1'}, {'key': 'dimensions', 'value': '6.00 (w) x 9.00 (h) x 0.70 (d)'}, {'key': 'isbn13', 'value': '9780226014876'}, {'key': 'msrp', 'value': '28'}, {'key': 'isbn', 'value': '226014878'}, {'key': 'isbn10', 'value': '226014878'}], 'publisher': {'id': 1379, 'name': 'University of Chicago Press'}}\n",

Shortly after her arrival, the prim 32-year-old receives a life-threatening letter. She refuses, however, to let the letter put a damper on her opportunity to experience real freedom--at least until, at her father's insistence, NOPD officer Beau Dupree is assigned as her bodyguard for the duration of her stay. Dupree, who spent the past decade raising three sisters after his parents' untimely death, is equally unhappy about the situation and has better things to do than baby-sit a grown woman, especially a snobby Yankee.

During a car trip from Ohio to Idaho with her grandparents, true originals, Sal relates all that has happened the past year after her mother\\'s sudden departure from home. A story within a story, Sal tells about Phoebe Winterbottom, her charismatic friend, who exaggerates, who believes she is being stalked by a \"lunatic,\" who avoids cholesterol, unless it\\'s her mother\\'s brownies, and whose mother also has left home. Themes of love, life, death, and relationships are at the core of this story which is playful, imaginative, and satisfying.

And now a family crisis is calling her home&#151;back to the mystery, back to the shadows...back to North, the \"bad boy\" turned respected, prize-winnning journalist. But some things never change. Dark secrets long denied must finally be revealed. And a youthful passion interrupted but never destroyed must be rapturously reborn as adult love if Delia is to be truly free.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Johnston exhibits her versatility with a venture into mainstream, contemporary romance genre. The quick-paced love story/ murder mystery evolves when New York City judge, Delia Carson, is notified by her sister that her mother, whom she hasn\\'t seen in 20 years, is near death. Flooded by memories of her hidden past, Delia is forced to return to her Texas hometown, the scene of lost innocence, lost love and murder. The lost love is March North, the former town bad boy who has now returned as an award-winning journalist. Delia has no choice but to finally confront her past and Marsh, whom she had left behind to take the blame for her own dark deeds. The psychological repercussions of child molestation are movingly depicted in the sister\\'s character, but the book lacks the same insight when dealing with its effects on Delia and Marsh. Johnston tackles a very tough subject but unfortunately, she misses the chance for a really hard-hitting story.

An applied animal behaviorist and dog trainer with more than twenty years experience, Dr. Patricia McConnell looks at humans as just another interesting species, and muses about why we behave the way we do around our dogs, how dogs might interpret our behavior, and how to interact with our dogs in ways that bring out the best in our four-legged friends.<u> </u><b><br><br></b>After all, although humans and dogs share a remarkable relationship that is unique in the animal world, we are still two entirely different species, each shaped by our individual evolutionary heritage. Quite simply, humans are primates and dogs are canids (like wolves, coyotes, and foxes). Since we each speak a different native tongue, a lot gets lost in the translation.<br><br><i>The Other End of the Leash</i> demonstrates how even the slightest changes in your voice and the way you stand can help your dog understand what you want. Once you start to think about your own behavior from the perspective of your dog, you&#8217;ll understand why much of what appears to be doggy-disobedience is simply a case of miscommunication. Inside you will learn<br>&#8226; How to use your voice so that your dog is more likely to do what you ask.<br>&#8226; Why &#8220;getting dominance&#8221; over your dog is a bad idea.<br>&#8226; Why &#8220;rough and tumble primate play&#8221; can lead to trouble&#8211;and how to play with your dog in ways that are fun and keep him out of trouble.<br>&#8226; How dogs and humans share personality types&#8211;and why most dogs want to live with benevolent leaders rather than &#8220;alphawannabees!&#8221;<br><br>In her own insightful, compelling style, Patricia McConnell combines wonderful true stories about people and dogs with a new, accessible scientific perspective on how they should behave around each other. This is a book that strives to help you make the most of life with your dog, and to prevent problems that might arise in that most rewarding of relationships.<br><br><br> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> It matters greatly that people who love dogs understand enough about them to provide a good environment, writes McConnell (Feeling Outnumbered? How to Manage Your Multi-dog Household) in her thoughtful exposition on improving human-canine communication. An animal behaviorist and adjunct professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin Madison, McConnell offers sound advice for dog owners: Pay attention to your own behavior. Believe me, your dog is. Drawing on anecdotes from her professional practice (she specializes in canine behavior problems), research into the work of other dog trainers and personal experiences with her beloved Border collies, the author explains how a dog might be misinterpreting signals from its owner. For example, although humans express affection through hugs, a dog may feel threatened by them. McConnell also provides tips on how to play safely with dogs (she recommends games of fetch rather than rough-and-tumble wrestling) and how to get them to do what you want (the best way to get a dog to stop demanding attention is simply to break off visual contact). She has harsh words for trainers who tell owners to establish dominance over dogs by behaving aggressively to them when they are young, and also for owners of puppy mills. These dog factories, she says, create damaged animals and unsuitable pets. This is a helpful guide for pet owners by a specialist who clearly loves her work. B&w photos not seen by PW.

After reading it, you may still think the French are arrogant, aloof, and high-handed, but you will know why.&quot; <br>--Wall Street Journal<br><br>Decrypting French ideas about land, food, privacy, and language, and more, the authors weave together the threads of French society for a fresh take on a country that no one can seem to understand. <h3>Library Journal</h3> In 1999, freelance bilingual Canadian journalists Nadeau and Barlow traveled to France under the auspices of the Institute of Current World Affairs. Their goal? To determine how France has been coping with the new forces of globalization and modern times in general. The product of their effort is a wide-ranging discussion of the French character and how it has changed since World War II. Their overwhelming generalizations are based mostly on conversations with a variety of sources from seat companions on transatlantic flights to high-level government and business officials. The authors\\' intent \"is not a history of France. Neither is it a specialized study of sociology, demography, political theory, or economics. [It] is a study of France.\" Therein lies the problem: the approach is so inclusive that any reader, except those quite familiar with France, will have a hard time understanding what Nadeau and Barlow are trying to convey. Unfortunately, neither an index nor a bibliography is provided. Readers may find more satisfaction in Julian Barnes\\'s Something To Declare: Essays on France. Not recommended.-Olga B.
